# Nc-ML-Workflow-Project
My Final project to Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker

The final Project was so challenging to me and I spent a lot of time debugging and troubleshooting my codes including Lambda functions, Step Functions, etc. 
Here I've added solution to my final workflow project that I'm proud of. You can find the source starter code of this project on Udacity Github with below link:
